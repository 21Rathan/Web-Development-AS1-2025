      Learning the basics of web development this term has been a fun and
      challenging experience. At the start, I didnt know much about HTML or
      CSS, but as the weeks went by, I began to understand how websites are
      structured and styled. Building my portfolio site helped me apply these
      skills and gave me a chance to get creative with design choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the biggest ups was seeing the site come to life â€” adding new
      sections, styling them, and watching everything come together visually.
      It was really satisfying when things worked as expected. That said, not
      everything went smoothly. Debugging CSS layout issues was probably the
      most frustrating part of the process. Sometimes, a small typo or misplaced
      bracket could break the entire layout! But over time, I got better at
      reading the errors and fixing them step by step.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the design, I wanted the site to feel modern but friendly. I used a
      navy blue color scheme because its calming and looks professional. I
      chose a sans-serif font (like Open Sans) for readability and clean
      aesthetics. I also added some CSS animations to make the site feel more
      interactive and lively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this project helped me build confidence in both the technical and
      creative sides of web development. I now understand the importance of
      planning layouts, choosing accessible color schemes, and writing clean
      code. Im excited to keep learning and take on more complex projects in
      the future!
