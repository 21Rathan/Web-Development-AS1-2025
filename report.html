        <p>Learning the basics of web development has been really enjoyable. Firstly creating this portfolio has come with ups and downs as not everything works to begin with.
            The ups of Learning basic web development is the satisfaction of when something works adn you can see your creation. The downs however is that my code didnt always work
            meaning i couldnt debug my code, however this allowed me to go back through my code and fix the problem. The design choice i have chosen is quite interactive and fun as i wanted my website too be fun and animated,
            I have mainly used the colour navy as it is not too harsh on the eyes but not too boring either.
