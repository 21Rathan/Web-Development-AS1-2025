        <!--PARAGRAPH-->
        <p> Learning the basics of web development this term has been a fun and challenging experience.  At the start, I didn’t know much about HTML or CSS, but as the weeks went by, I began to understand how websites are structured and styled. Building my portfolio site helped me apply these skills and gave me a chance to get creative with design choices.

One of the biggest ups was seeing the site come to life — adding new sections, styling them, and watching everything come together visually. It was really satisfying when things worked as expected. That said, not everything went smoothly. Debugging CSS layout issues was probably the most frustrating part of the process. Sometimes, a small typo or misplaced bracket could break the entire layout! But over time, I got better at reading the errors and fixing them step by step.

For the design, I wanted the site to feel modern but friendly. I used a navy blue color scheme because it’s calming and looks professional. I chose a sans-serif font (like Open Sans) for readability and clean aesthetics. I also added some CSS animations to make the site feel more interactive and lively.

Overall, this project helped me build confidence in both the technical and creative sides of web development. I now understand the importance of planning layouts, choosing accessible color schemes, and writing clean code. I’m excited to keep learning and take on more complex projects in the future!
