        <p>Learning the basics of web development has been a rewarding and enjoyable journey. Creating this portfolio gave me the opportunity to apply new skills and bring my ideas to life. While there were some challenges along the way, the process helped me grow as a developer.
One of the highlights was the satisfaction of seeing my code work and watching the site come together visually. On the other hand, I did face difficulties — not everything worked the first time, and debugging issues could be frustrating. However, these setbacks taught me to be patient and persistent. By reviewing and correcting my code, I gained a deeper understanding of how everything fits together.
For the design, I wanted the website to feel fun, interactive, and engaging. I incorporated animated elements to add movement and personality to the pages. I chose a navy colour scheme because it’s calm and easy on the eyes, while still maintaining a modern and professional look.
Overall, this project has helped me build confidence in web development and has motivated me to continue learning and improving.
